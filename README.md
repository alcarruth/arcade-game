## Playing the Game

The player is represented by the boy image on the bottom row which can be
moved up, down, left and right by using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
The objective is to reach the water on the top row without getting hit by
any of the bugs.

At the top of the game you'll find the score board which indicates how many
lives you have remaining and your score (currently just how many times you've
successfully crosses to the water).

If you get hit by a bug, you lose a life and the player is reset to the
initial position.

If you reach the water, you gain a point and the player is reset to the
initial position.

## TODO:

Add additional functionality to the game such as:
 * collectible items on screen
 * multiple vehicle types
 * timed games
 * settings menu
 * player's choice of icon
 * awesome sound effects
